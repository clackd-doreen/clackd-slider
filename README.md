# clackd-slider

## how to make it work

1. `git clone` into an empty folder
2. `npm i`: installs necessary dependencies
3. `npm run dev`: to run the slider locally


## notes

- added lightbox functionality on image click in case the user wants to view the image at full width/height of the screen


## concerns

- still ironing out animations and design since i am not a designer :^) it was fun to learn though
- pagination / dots are a bit buggy still since the dots do not move if user's as the edge of the dots slider
- will fix `npm run build` later to get building for production (aka not locally) working
- 

cheers
